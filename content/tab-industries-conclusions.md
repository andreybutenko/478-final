# Analysis

**The first plot** enables the 5 states of highest and lowest prevalence to be compared individually. This is a useful tool to compare small sets of states, but it is challenging to make generalized conclusions since each state is unique and trends are difficult to identify.

To identify trends, **the second plot and its associated table** enables the 5 states of highest prevalence to be compared against the 20 states of lowest prevalence. Since prevalence distribution is very positively skewed as revealed by the histogram, the 20 states of lowest prevalence should have similarities in the same way as the 5 states of highest prevalence. Using more states limits the influence of outliers.

Considering this second plot alongside its associated table, we find that:

- **States of low COVID-19 prevalence tend to have more jobs in accomodations and food services, manufacturing, administration and support, construction, and government than states of high COVID-19 prevalence.** This is also surprising. Given that food service, manufacturing, and construction jobs are impossible to do from home and their workplaces are difficult to social-distance, one would expect states with more of those jobs to have *higher* COVID-19 prevalence.

- **States of high COVID-19 prevalence tend to have more jobs in health care, education, finance, and professional/technical services than states of low COVID-19 prevalence.** This is suprising. Given that education, finance, and professional/technical jobs are easier to work from home, one would expect states with more of those jobs to have *lower* COVID-19 prevalence.
  
This demonstrates a fault in this sub-question: distribution of jobs by industry primary reveals the economy and development of the state rather than factors in COVID-19 spread. States with high COVID-19 prevalence have more jobs that can be done remotely, but these states also tend to be more developed, have higher density, and have more visitors which make their communities vulnerable to COVID-19 spread. States with low COVID-19 prevalence have less jobs that can be done remotely, but these states also tend to be less developed, have lower density, and have less visitors which protect their communities from COVID-19 spread.

With this, we cannot make a conclusion on the relationship between workplace environment and the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. However, this provides some indication that a state's level of development and density may influence spread.
