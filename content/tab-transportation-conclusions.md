# Public Transportation Analysis
**the first plot** allows to toggle between different ways of commuting to work.
The plot first sorts the top five and the bottom five states by whatever commuting method is chosen. It then plots them in a graph sorted by COVID-19
positive cases. Finally, the color is the commuting ratio. This tool can help to
understand which states have public transportation infrastructures as well as
show how the preferred method of commuting impacts the spread of COVID-19.

Initially, we expected to see the states with public transportation infrastructure to have a higher rate of COVID-19. This was consistent in out findings. surprisingly, when looking at the *Drive to Work* metric, the states with high COVID-19 spread also had a fair amount of people who decide to drive to work. This may be due to the volume of commuters. Even if everyone drives to work, the volume of people may be high, which could also lead to more daily interactions, and therefore, more COVID-19 spread.

The **second and third plots** looked at the relationship between public transportation and COVID-19 at a city level. The map shows COVID-19 rates by zip code and NYC subway locations. The bar plot shows COVID spread by borough with subway traffic mapped to color.

Both of these visualizations provide valuable information on he relationship between COVID-19 and public transportation:

- Neighborhoods with less stations tend to have a higher rate of COVID-19 in the population. This may be due to where stations are built in the first place. The purpose of these stations could be to move commuters from residential zones to commercial offices and workplaces. Manhattan, which has the highest concentration of subway stations also has the lowest rate of COVID-19 in the population. Manhattan could have a higher percentage of commercial zones, which would impact the commuters that work there greatly.

- The boroughs when plotted against subway traffic and COVID-19 spread have a negative relationship to each other. This seems counterintuitive at first, but additional research may have to be done to understand this relationship. One proposal is how COVID-19 spread is measured. If a person in a household contracts COVID-19.

These visualizations provide good initial information about the relationship between public transportation and COVID-19, but additional research needs to be done to fully understand the complete picture. The NYC data shows what is seemingly counterintuitive. additional research into this could include mapping residential data, finding out how COVID-19 rates are measured. Perhaps collecting information on contact tracing reveals that most cases started in the crowded Manhattan. These questions can be answered by taking the initial information in this analysis and combining it wit different datasets and metrics.
