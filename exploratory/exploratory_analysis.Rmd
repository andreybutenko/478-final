<h3>Analysis</h3>

These three visualizations assess the distribution of positive COVID-19 testing rates. In other words, these visualizations show what proportion of COVID-19 tests have positive results in a way that enables us to compare this rate across states and across regions.

The distribution of COVID-19-positive testing rates by state is positively skewed. The majority of states have low rates of COVID-19-positive tests.

This is evident in the visualizations, but also in the table summary. The median positive testing rate is 9.2%, so half of U.S. states have a positive testing rate of less than 9.2%. The upper quartile positive testing rate is 14.6%, so three-quarters of U.S. states have a positive testing rate of less than 14.6%. The most extreme example of this positive skew are naturally-isolated states like Hawaii and Alaska where less than 2.9% of tests are positive.

However, the maximum testing rate is 55%. The most extreme examples of this are are New York, New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Michigan which have 40%-55% positive testing rates.

A limitation of assessing this metric is that it reflects testing strategy as well as COVID-19 prevalance. A state with a high positive testing rate could reflect one of two scenarios. First, that state could have a low COVID-19 prevalance, but is testing people who are pretty certain to have COVID-19. Second, that state could have a high COVID-19 prevalence, but is testing most people.

For this reason, the distribution of this metric alone is insufficient. In addition, the distribution of prevalance should be considered.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
